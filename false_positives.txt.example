# False Positives - Subdomain Takeover Detection
# Add one subdomain per line to exclude from vulnerability reports
# Lines starting with # are comments
#
# Use this file to exclude subdomains that appear vulnerable but are
# known to be safe (e.g., intentional non-resolving CNAMEs, domains
# in migration, third-party services with expected behavior).
#
# Example entries:
# host.REMOVED.com
# staging.example.com
# legacy-app.example.com
